- The data cover all transactions made between April 1st, 2013 and March 31st, 2014. 

- The return policy has changed from 90 days to 45 days on October 1st, 2013.

- Brand_number =5 : Secondary brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =3 : Outlet brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =8 : Sister brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =2 : Primary brand - brick-and-mortar stores 

- There are three online channel stores with store numbers 2 (primary brand), 6 (secondary brand), and 10 (sister brand)

- The return policy for online store 10 and for all sister brand brick-and-mortar stores (stores under Brand_number=8)
has not changed. For those stores, the return policy was a 60 days-return policy before October 1st, 2013, and is still a 60-days return policy.

- There are four different dta datasets. You can read a dataset using the following command that can be accessed after installing "readstata13" package in R 

   read.dta13("PATH TO THE FILE/file_name.dta")

   Example: Assuming the data file is on desktop,
   read.dta13("C:/Users/nertekin/Desktop/BM store monthly sales-returns.dta")

- Two of the datasets are for BM stores and two of them are online stores. 
- You have two files for each channel because the data is constructed in two different ways. 
  (a) For BM stores, the monthly sales-returns dataset includes sales and returns at each store for a given month. 
      The monthly prod_cat sales-returns dataset includes sales and returns for each product category at store for a given month
  (b) For online stores, the daily sales-returns dataset includes sales and returns at each store for a given day. 
      The monthly prod_cat sales-returns dataset includes sales and returns for each product category at store for a given day

- In each dataset, the control variables that start with "avg_" indicate the mean of those variables at the aggregated level. 
  For instance, avg_female in monthly sales-returns dataset represents the ratio of female customers to all customers who shopped at a store in a given month.
  The same variable in the monthly sales-returns prod_cat dataset represents the ratio of female customers to all customers who purchased a product in a given product category at a store in a given day
